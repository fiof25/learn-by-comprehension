It’s been a distressing season for many
farmers and ranchers in Alberta,
Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.
Canada’s Prairie region is known for its
vast grasslands, fertile farmland, and
rich energy resources. For many years,
'Canada's breadbasket' has produced
over 90 percent of the country's wheat,
and many other crops. The flat prairie
plains are ideally suited for growing
food to feed Canadians and to export
around the world.

But meagre rainfall and an
unseasonably hot spring and early
summer parched many of the rich and
vibrant fields. Rivers, lakes, and even
dugouts—small artificial ponds farmers
dig to collect rain and snowmelt for
livestock—began to dry out.
Emergency conditions
In May, the situation was so bad that
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada
classified 77 percent of the Prairie
region as either Abnormally Dry or
as experiencing Moderate to Extreme
Drought. Soil moisture levels across 72
percent of the agricultural landscape 
fell to record lows. 

Conditions deteriorated so much that several
areas declared agricultural states of
emergency.
Worse, this is the ninth consecutive
year that the Prairies have
experienced drought. “Everything
is short, everything is dying,” said
Saskatchewan farmer Virginia Maier.
“When [drought] goes on for so many
years, it’s starting to get depressing.”
Crops and animals suffer
The impact on farming was immediate
and severe. Crops like wheat, canola,
and barley that usually flourish were
threatened. Ranchers faced barren
pastures and sold off cattle—they
didn’t have enough hay to feed the
hungry animals. Some turned to
irrigation, but due to scarce water
supplies, the cost of piping in the
precious liquid skyrocketed. Some
farmers purchased feed to keep their
livestock alive. These were costly and
temporary fixes.
Wildlife also felt the strain. Thirsty
and desperate deer, elk, and other 
animals moved closer to settlements
to find water. Birds responded to the
dry environment by shifting migration
routes and changing their habits. Fish
populations in lakes and warming
rivers declined as they struggled to
survive in shrinking habitats.
Relief for some . . .
Thankfully, by mid-August,
circumstances had improved in some
areas. Heavy precipitation in late
June—a welcome surprise—pulled
central Alberta and west-central
Saskatchewan back from the brink,
with some areas receiving over 100
millimetres of rain. That bolstered
soil moisture levels and decreased the
worst of the drought conditions.
. . .but not for others
However, much of southern
Saskatchewan and Manitoba stayed
very dry. In Saskatchewan, only about
23 percent of cropland topsoil had
adequate moisture. That means that
just a small portion of the soil’s upper
layer—where crops grow and absorb
water—had enough water to support 
healthy plant growth. The remaining
77 percent of the soil was either “short”
or “very short” of moisture.
The wildfire factor
Adding to the problem? Across
Canada, wildfires reached alarming
levels in recent months. By early
August, over 6.5 million hectares
had burned across the country. Over
half of this territory was in Manitoba
and Saskatchewan, but large parts of
Alberta were in flames as well.
The blazes threatened farms, towns,
and many isolated rural and First
Nations communities. Emergency
personnel were stretched thin.
Canada’s military helped with
evacuations. Other countries, such
as Mexico, Australia, and the United
States, sent personnel and equipment
to help with evacuations and
firefighting.
But despite their efforts, tinderbox
conditions and the many raging fires
caused air quality to deteriorate,
posing many health risks—especially
to children, the elderly, and those with
breathing problems.
A Canada-wide issue
Sadly, the Prairie region wasn’t the
only area grappling with tinder-dry
conditions. Southwestern Ontario
experienced drought that affected corn
and soybean crops. Forests, especially
maple and other hardwoods, were
stressed, and water levels in lakes and
rivers dropped, impacting fisheries.
Northern Ontario also saw many
wildfires.
Atlantic Canada was hit hard too, and
persistent heat and dry conditions
affected many areas. Much of the
region, including Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, as
well as parts of Newfoundland and
Labrador, experienced below-normal
rainfall, with some areas getting less
than 60 to 85 percent of their usual 
precipitation levels. Halifax recorded
rainfall at 60 percent of normal levels
from April to July. Some outdoor
activities were banned, and some
Crown lands were closed to the public.
Fierce wildfires broke out in eastern
Newfoundland after low winter
precipitation and one of the hottest
and driest summers ever. Many states
of emergency were declared, and
thousands of people fled to safety.
Evacuation alerts were issued in
multiple areas as officials monitored
fire behaviour.
The bigger picture
The circumstances causing drought
conditions are part of a broader
climate story. The severe droughts are
linked to shifting jet stream patterns,
which influence weather. Long-term
climate change is also making extreme
conditions more common and more
intense. The need for a coordinated
response and collaboration between
provinces has never been greater
to better manage water resources,
fight fires, and support affected
communities
The toll on Prairie crops
Meanwhile, in southwestern
Saskatchewan and parts of Alberta
and Manitoba, the drought has caused
stunted crop growth, rapid maturity,
and uneven development. Farmers are
reporting yields so low that some plan
to use what they reap for animal feed.
Yet surprisingly, overall crop yield
forecasts for the Prairies remain
relatively solid. Agriculture Canada
says that many spring-planted crops,
including wheat and canola, could
be near or even above the fiveyear average in some areas due to
favourable weather in other parts
of Western Canada. And barley
production should be just below the
five-year average.
Still, given the ongoing risk of drought
and wildfires, farming and ranching
are under serious stress.
“I’m going to scrape through [for]
maybe another year,” says Quinton
Jacksteit, a Saskatchewan farmer, “but
I have a couple of boys that want to
farm, and it’s not something that I
would recommend to them.” J
