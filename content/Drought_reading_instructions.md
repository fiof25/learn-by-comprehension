Question: 
How did the drought affect forests and non-farming communities across Canada?

#Jamie’s Initial Stance:
The drought affected crops like wheat, canola, and barley. People at the ranch faced barren pastures and sold off cattle, and turned to irrigation but due to scarce water supplies it became too expensive. 

(Not wrong, but unrelated as the question is asking how they affected non-farming communities. Doesn’t mention anything related to how the drought affected forests and non-farming communities. Requires the user to break down the question in an understandable way.)

#Thomas’ Initial Stance:
The drought affected forests by making trees dry and unhealthy, which caused problems for animals living there. It impacted non-farming communities because some people had to change their routines and deal with environmental challenges. Overall, the drought made life harder outside of farming areas as nature was damaged.

(Too vague, misses evidence, focuses on animals and doesn’t really focus on how non-farming communities were affected. Requires the user to provide strong evidence for each point to develop the answer)


#Model Answer:
Due to tinder-dry conditions and below-normal levels of rainfall, wildfires reached alarming high levels, including over 6.5 million hectares burning across the country. The fires blazed through farms, towns and many isolated rural and First Nations communities, causing air quality to deteriorate and posing many health risks to children, the elderly and those with breathing problems. Many fierce wildfires broke out in Eastern Newfoundland, where people experienced high hot and dry summers, which led to many outdoor activities being banned and thousands of people evacuating their homes to safety.
